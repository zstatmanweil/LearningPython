## Summary

I created shot charts showing and analyzing NBA players' field goals made and field goal attempts in the past season. This script was modeled after some of the code written in this [blog](http://savvastjortjoglou.com/nba-shot-sharts.html).

## Analysis
I enjoyed exploring the data to see if I could gain insight into the players' habits. I noticed Klay Thompson shot way more threes on the right side, but did he make more? Turns out in the 2017-18 season, Klay made 45.7% on the right and 45.2% on the left.
